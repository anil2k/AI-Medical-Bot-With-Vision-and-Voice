Dandruff is a common condition that causes flakes of skin to appear on the scalp, and it can be caused by a variety of factors such as dry skin, sensitivity to hair products, or an overgrowth of yeast on the scalp. To treat dandruff, I would recommend using an anti-dandruff shampoo containing ingredients like zinc pyrithione or ketoconazole, which can help reduce the amount of yeast on the scalp and relieve symptoms. Additionally, it may be helpful to use a medicated shampoo once or twice a week, and to reduce the frequency of washing your hair to avoid stripping it of its natural oils.",.gradio\flagged\Medical Bot Audio\a244384a05e29df96040\final.mp3,2025-04-08 22:00:55.870796
